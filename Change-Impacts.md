Accretion | The build-up of sediments to form land or shoaling in coastal waters or waterways. It may be either natural or artificial. Natural accretion is the build-up of land on the beach, dunes, or in the water by natural processes, such as waves, current and wind. Artificial accretion is a similar build-up of land resulting from built structures such as groynes or breakwaters, or activities such as filling and beach nourishment, or also aggradation.|The build-up of sediments to form land or shoaling in coastal waters or waterways.

Algal bloom | A sudden proliferation of algae (microscopic plants) that occurs near the surface of a body of water. Blooms can occur due to natural nutrient cycles or can be in response to eutrophication or climate variations.||||
Algal dieback | Loss of algae (microscopic plants) that occurs near the surface of a body of water.||||
Bare soil exposure | Appearance of underlying soil following human or natural disturbance, such as removal of top soil prior to urban construction or grazing of natural vegetation.||||
Blackwater event | When organic material is inundated or washed into waterways and consumed by bacteria, leading to a sudden depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water.||||
Browning | A decrease in the amount or loss of photosynthetically active pigments (primarily chlorophylls) in vegetation.||||
Building or infrastructure abandonment | Buildings that are no longer habited or in use.||||
Compaction | Process that brings about an increase in soil density or unit weight, accompanied by a decrease in air volume.||||
Coral bleaching | When the coral host expels its zooxanthellae (marine algae living in symbiosis with the coral) in response to increased water temperatures, often resulting in the death of the coral.||||
Coral damage | Physical damage or loss of a coral reef that is not the result of changes in water temperature.||||
Coral recovery | Re-instatement of the previous extent or health of reef-building corals.
Crop change in cultivated lands | Replacement of one crop type by another.||||
Crop damage | Loss of or harm to crops during or following a disturbance.||||
Crop establishment | Planting of crops in an area on ploughed land.||||
Cropland gain | Increase of total cropping area or total area sown.||||
Cropland loss | Decrease of total cropping area or total area sown.||||
Decreased wave action | Decreased disturbance on the surface of a liquid body, as the sea or a lake, in the form of a moving ridge or swell.||||
Deglaciation | The uncovering of glaciated land because of melting or sublimation of a glacier.||||
Desalinisation | The process of soils becoming less salty; the reduction of soluble salts in water bodies.||||
Desertification | Reduction in the productivity of the land that is not reversible. In other words, land is desertified when it can no longer support the same plant growth it had in the past, and the change is permanent on a human time scale.||||
Elevation change | Change in the altitude above a reference sea or ground level.||||
Erosion | Geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water.||||
Flooding | Overflow of water across an area.||||
Geomorphological change | A topographic adjustment that changes the geometry of landforms. Examples include estuarine evolution and beach rotation in coastal areas and mountain uplift.||||
Glaciation | Expansion of ice or glacier cover.||||
Greening | An increase in the amount of photosynthetically active pigments (primarily chlorophylls) in vegetation.||||
Increased sediment load | Increase in the amount of a substance discharged into a body of water (e.g., salt or sediment).||||
Inundation | Progressive submergence of land or structures by water.||||
Invasive or exotic species | A plant or animal that has been introduced into a region (terrestrial or aquatic) in which it does not naturally occur and that becomes established and spreads, displacing naturally occurring species.||||
Lava flow | A mass of molten rock produced during the eruption of a volcano and moving down its sides.||||
Leaf scorch | A non-infectious, physiological condition caused by unfavourable environmental situations. It is not caused by fungus, bacteria, or virus. The problem may appear on almost any plant if weather conditions are favourable, such as high temperatures, dry winds, salt carrying winds and low soil moisture.||||

Sea level rise | An increase in the mean level of the oceans. Relative sea level increase occurs where there is a local increase in the level of the ocean relative to the land, which might be caused by ocean rising, the land subsiding, or both. In areas with rapid land level uplift (e.g., seismically active areas), relative sea level can fall.||||
Sedimentation | Deposition of sediment from flowing water (in channels or floodplains) or standing water (in wetlands, lakes, or oceans).||||
