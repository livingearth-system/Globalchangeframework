Accretion	|	The build-up of sediments to form land or shoaling in coastal waters or waterways. It may be either natural or artificial. Natural accretion is the build-up of land on the beach, dunes, or in the water by natural processes, such as waves, current and wind. Artificial accretion is a similar build-up of land resulting from built structures such as groynes or breakwaters, or activities such as filling and beach nourishment, or also aggradation.	|	The definition for this term is re-used from 'Costal Management Glossary', Office of Environment and Heritage © 2018 State of NSW and Office of Environment and Heritage.
