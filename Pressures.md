Pressures are the reasons for observed changes in the state, measured by physical, chemical and/or biological characteristics of the environment. Pressures can exert adverse (negative) or positive influences on the ecosystem as a whole, or on different ecosystem components (e.g., vegetation, soil, water, air) in relation to the functions they fulfil. Pressures can also be introduced (e.g., through policy, practice) to enact change. 

The following list 144 pressures that have been identified.
