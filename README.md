# Introducing the Global Change Taxonomy and Evidence-Based Change Framework
The Global Change Taxonomy currently lists 248 classes based on the notation ‘impact (pressure)’, with this encompassing the consequence of observed change and associated reason(s), and uses scale-independent terms that factor in time. 

Each impact and pressure term is defined separately in this online glossary to ensure consistent use and common understanding, allowing flexible combination into ‘impact (pressure)’ categories. The glossary is open for review and you are invited to suggest additional terms or amendments, which will be reviewed on a regular basis with an annual update planned.
